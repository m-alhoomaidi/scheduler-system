# PostgreSQL Persistence (Future Use)

This folder is reserved for PostgreSQL adapters and repositories.

Although `scheduler-api` currently uses MongoDB, this folder anticipates a future refactor or shared models with other services that persist to PostgreSQL.

Examples of potential contents:
- TypeORM or Prisma models
- Repository adapters for relational data
- Read-optimized projections
